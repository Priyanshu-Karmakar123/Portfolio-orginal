    <h2>Who am I...</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Priyanshu Karmakar.
    I have passed out from School in 2019 and thereafter joined KIIT University,Odissa 
    to do my B.Tech in CS-IT.</p>
    <p>During first semester classes I have decided that I will go for Higher
        Studies but I was not fully focusing on that.
        I used to attend regular classes, do well i exams and that was all about me.
        
    </p>
    <p>After 8 months of class, a disaster came with the name called 'Covid-19'. We came back home,
        after few days online classes started and agin life was becoming 'normal'. After a semester the thought of
        GATE Exam again came. This time I tried to approach different faculties but did'nt get positive responses except 
        from one teacher, Prof. Suresh Ch. Moharana. He gave me advices regarding how I should prepare, which subjets 
        I should take in B.Tech level, and I was preparing well for GATE 2022 under his guidance and mentorship.
        But life has decided different fate for me, as always.. :)

    </p>

    <p> In year 2021, afer the end sem of fourth semester, I got the news that Prof.
        Suresh Moharana is not well. I tried to contact him, even texted him directly about 
        his health issues.
        At around 11 in the night the message came that Prof. Moharana is no more.
        Then I realize that the reply for which I am waiting from evening in Whatsapp is not 
        going to come!
        The more interesting thing is that, the day was 20th May, my Birthday!
    </p>
    <p>Again after days, a new semester came, new subjects with new faculties.<br>
       Prof. Pratyusa Mukherjee<br>
       GATE 2022 failure<br>
       Decided wrong coaching classes<br>
       Resulting again failure in GATE 2023<br>
       Everybody else has got into jobs<br>
       I joined offline GATE coaching classes<br>
       Preparing for GATE 2024,
       and waiting for achieving AIR 1...
